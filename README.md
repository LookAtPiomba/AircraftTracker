## Introduction
>" A private jet flight causes about 10 times more CO2 emissions than a regular flight per flight per person, and 50 times more than the average train ride.  
> [...] In just one hour, a single private jet can emit two tonnes of CO2. The global average energy-related carbon footprint is around 4.7 tonnes of CO2 per person per year. " [(greenpeace.org)](https://www.greenpeace.org/international/act/ban-private-jets/)

In an era where environmental awareness and concern for climate change are increasingly urgent, analyzing emissions from industries related to air travel, such as private jets, plays a crucial role in understanding the environmental impact of such activities and identifying more eco-friendly alternatives.

As European citizens, we know that EU aims to become carbon neutral by 2050. To try to achieve so, the European Commission has proposed a new climate law to ensure that all EU policies contribute to the climate neutrality objective. [(ec.europa.eu)](https://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/eu-climate-action/law_en)

Whereas there are industries that surely contribute more on climate change than private jets, we believe that it is important to analyze the emissions of this industry, as it is a luxury industry that is not essential for the functioning of society and could be easily replaced by other means of transport.  
According to the European Commission, aviation represented 4% of total EU emissions pre-pandemic, representing a key industry to reign in regarding its carbon footprint. [(ec.europa.eu)](https://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/transport/aviation_en)

One alternative to the complete ban of private jets, would be to tax them based on the CO2 emissions. In fact, the European Commission has proposed to include aviation in the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) from 2021.  
However, despite ranking among two of the leading producers of carbon emissions, it is said that "both private jets and cargo flights are to be exempt from this newly proposed jet fuel tax". [(flybitlux.com)](https://flybitlux.com/eu-proposes-to-exempt-private-jets-from-fuel-tax/)

Taxing private jets based on their CO2 emissions would be a step forward in the fight against climate change, not only because it will discourage the use of this means of transport, but also because these moneys could be used to finance other more eco-friendly means of transport and to invest in research and development of new technologies that could reduce the carbon footprint of the aviation industry.

## Project Purpose

Our main objective is to closely examine the routes of private jets connecting Italian airports during the year 2022. Through a comprehensive analysis, we will explore the most frequently used routes, with a special focus on the ones that could be easily replaced by more sustainable modes of transportation. Our intention is to quantify the emissions generated by these flights and compare them with potential "green" solutions, in order to assess the effectiveness of policies like bans or emissions taxation.

## Methodology

To achieve our goal, we will follow a series of methodological steps:

1. **Data Collection**: We will gather data concerning the routes of private jets connecting Italian airports in 2022, including details about airlines, flight frequencies, and distances traveled. We will also collect data on the emissions produced by these flights, as well as the emissions produced by alternative means of transportation, such as high-speed trains.  

    - *Data on flights and aircraft will be collected from [OpenSky Network](https://opensky-network.org/).*  
    - *Data on airports will be collected from [HDX](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/ourairports-ita?force_layout=desktop).*  
    - *Data on trains will be collected from [HDX](https://data.humdata.org).*  
    - *Data on italian boundaries are collected from [Istat](https://www.istat.it/it/archivio/222527)*  

2. **Emissions Calculation**: We will employ standard methodologies to calculate greenhouse gas emissions produced by jets that flew over these routes, taking into account some available factors such as fuel used, engine type, and passenger capacity.

3. **Identifying Replaceable Routes**: We will analyze the most flown route with a particular focus on alternative land transportation, such as high-speed trains, to determine if these routes could be easily replaced by more eco-friendly means.

4. **Emissions Comparison**: We will compare emissions from private jets with theoretical estimates of emissions produced by more sustainable alternatives for the selected routes.

## Some results
In 2022, private jet flights between italian airports tracked by OpenSkyNetwork have been 1236 in total. The total private jet aviation in Italy in 2022 was 55,624 flights according to [greenpeace](https://www.greenpeace.org/international/act/ban-private-jets/), so we are considering only 2.2% of the total flights, which, considering that flights to and for Italy from foreign countries are usually longer, means that we are considering probably less than 2% of the total emissions produced by private aviation in Italy in 2022.

**Total Emissions:**  
- In 2022, the flights considered has produced a total of around **1758 tons of CO2**.

### Analysis of the routes:

**Most flown route**: 
- in 2022, the most flown route was **Milan Linate - Rome Ciampino**, with **around 227 flights**, and emitting a total of around **373,8 tons of CO2**. This means that 373,8/227 = **1,65 tons of CO2 per flight** are emitted on this route, corresponding to slightly more than 1/3 of the average yearly emissions of a person for just one flight.

**Shortest routes**:
-  What should shock the most is that sometimes private jets are used to perform very short routes, such as **Venice - Treviso** or **Ciampino - Fiumicino**, which are only **23 and 38 km** respectively.
- **Milan Linate - Milan Malpensa**, which is only **64 km long**, and has been flown **around 20 times** in 2022, emitting a total of **around 3,7 tons of CO2**.

### Emissions comparison for the most flown route:

For just one fligth from Milan to Rome, when someone chooses to use a private jet emits **6 times more CO2** than who chooses commercial airplane, and **18 times more CO2** than who chooses a Frecciarossa train!

### Total emission comparison for the most flown route:

We multiplied each emission by the number of flights Rome-Milan in 2022:  

- If every one of these flights was performed using a commercial airplane, the total emissions would be around 14,1 tons of CO2, which is **around 70,5 tons of CO2 less than the emissions produced by private jets** per person.
- If every one of these flights was performed using a Frecciarossa train, the total emissions would be around  4,8 tons of CO2, which is **around 80 tons of CO2 less than the emissions produced by private jets** per person.

## Conclusions
In conclusion, this project has delved into the world of private jet aviation in Italy with the aim of shedding light on a complex issue. It is important to emphasize that the intention here is not to vilify private jet usage itself. Rather, the focus has been on identifying instances where private jet travel may be easily replaced by more environmentally responsible alternatives, such as train transportation.

The findings of this analysis have shown that there are indeed routes within Italy where emissions-friendly train travel can provide a viable and sustainable alternative to private jet flights. The environmental benefits of transitioning from private jets to trains on these routes are undeniable, as trains generally have a significantly lower carbon footprint per passenger-kilometer.

One potential solution to encourage a shift towards more sustainable transportation options is to implement a taxation system based on emissions for private jets, similar to the EU Emission Trading System (EU ETS). Such a system could incentivize private jet owners and operators to reduce their carbon emissions by either adopting cleaner technologies or opting for alternative modes of travel where feasible.  
If the hoped-for reduction does not take place, the tax revenues could be used to finance research and development of new technologies that could reduce the carbon footprint of the aviation industry.

It is crucial to recognize that addressing the environmental impact of private jet aviation in Italy, and globally, is a multifaceted challenge that requires collaboration between governments, businesses, and individuals. The introduction of emissions-based taxation is just one of many potential strategies to promote sustainability within the aviation industry.

In closing, the examination of private jet aviation in Italy has highlighted the importance of balancing the convenience and necessity of private jet travel with environmental responsibility. By embracing innovative solutions like emissions-based taxation and supporting eco-friendly alternatives, we can collectively work towards a more sustainable and greener future for air travel in Italy and the world in general.
