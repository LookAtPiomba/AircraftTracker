    "# Project Introduction: Private Jets pollution analysis\n",
    "\n",
    ">\" A private jet flight causes about 10 times more CO2 emissions than a regular flight per flight per person, and 50 times more than the average train ride.  \n",
    "> [...] In just one hour, a single private jet can emit two tonnes of CO2. The global average energy-related carbon footprint is around 4.7 tonnes of CO2 per person per year. \" [(greenpeace.org)](https://www.greenpeace.org/international/act/ban-private-jets/)\n",
    "\n",
    "In an era where environmental awareness and concern for climate change are increasingly urgent, analyzing emissions from industries related to air travel, such as private jets, plays a crucial role in understanding the environmental impact of such activities and identifying more eco-friendly alternatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "As European citizens, we know that EU aims to become carbon neutral by 2050. To try to achieve so, the European Commission has proposed a new climate law to ensure that all EU policies contribute to the climate neutrality objective. [(ec.europa.eu)](https://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/eu-climate-action/law_en)\n",
    "\n",
    "Whereas there are industries that surely contribute more on climate change than private jets, we believe that it is important to analyze the emissions of this industry, as it is a luxury industry that is not essential for the functioning of society and could be easily replaced by other means of transport.  \n",
    "According to the European Commission, aviation represented 4% of total EU emissions pre-pandemic, representing a key industry to reign in regarding its carbon footprint. [(ec.europa.eu)](https://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/transport/aviation_en)\n",
    "\n",
    "One alternative to the complete ban of private jets, would be to tax them based on the CO2 emissions. In fact, the European Commission has proposed to include aviation in the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) from 2021.  \n",
    "However, despite ranking among two of the leading producers of carbon emissions, it is said that \"both private jets and cargo flights are to be exempt from this newly proposed jet fuel tax\". [(flybitlux.com)](https://flybitlux.com/eu-proposes-to-exempt-private-jets-from-fuel-tax/)\n",
    "\n",
    "Taxing private jets based on their CO2 emissions would be a step forward in the fight against climate change, not only because it will discourage the use of this means of transport, but also because these moneys could be used to finance other more eco-friendly means of transport and to invest in research and development of new technologies that could reduce the carbon footprint of the aviation industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "Our main objective is to closely examine the routes of private jets connecting Italian airports during the year 2022. Through a comprehensive analysis, we will explore the most frequently used routes, with a special focus on short-distance ones that could be easily replaced by more sustainable modes of transportation. Our intention is to quantify the emissions generated by these flights and compare them with potential \"green\" solutions, in order to assess the effectiveness of policies like bans or emissions taxation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve our goal, we will follow a series of methodological steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Collection**: We will gather data concerning the routes of private jets connecting Italian airports in 2022, including details about airlines, flight frequencies, and distances traveled. We will also collect data on the emissions produced by these flights, as well as the emissions produced by alternative means of transportation, such as high-speed trains.  \n",
    "\n",
    "    *Data on flights and aircraft will be collected from [OpenSky Network](https://opensky-network.org/).*  \n",
    "    *Data on airports will be collected from [HDX](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/ourairports-ita?force_layout=desktop).*  \n",
    "    *Data on trains will be collected from [HDX](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/hotosm_ita_central_railways?).*  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Emissions Calculation**: We will employ standard methodologies to calculate greenhouse gas emissions produced by jets that flew over these routes, taking into account some available factors such as fuel used, engine type, and passenger capacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Identifying Replaceable Routes**: We will analyze short-distance routes with a particular focus on alternative land transportation, such as high-speed trains, to determine if these routes could be easily replaced by more eco-friendly means.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Emissions Comparison**: We will compare emissions from private jets with theoretical estimates of emissions produced by more sustainable alternatives for the selected routes.\n"
